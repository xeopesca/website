A Galician computer engineer, Pablo Belay, is making available as open source Xeopesca, to be used by fishing boats to optimise their catches and improve traceability of fish and fish-products. With the project he successfully completed his studies at the University of Coruña. Xeopesca is one of the contenders for this year's 'Best Graduation Project done with Free Software', organised by the government of the autonomous region.
